Johnson for a while before you find it ;-)\n\nWe three snagged the last table for four at about 6:10 on a Thursday night.  The cocktails seemed to be popular but we settled on a bottle of a nice, reasonably priced Sangiovese. When I asked about it she brought me a taste. To start we had: Ripped bread with eggplant and pork rillette and a beet (golden and red) salad. Main course was, for my companions, veal meatballs with green beans and eggplant in a light tomato sauce reduction and for me, roasted goat shank with garbanzos and cucumbers. Conversation slowed, Mmmms were said, happiness ensued. A raspberry buttermilk ice cream served with shortbread cookies dipped in chocolate ganache finished the meal. What a treat!\n\nI've been in some fancier restaurants in Madison since moving here. They've tended to be a bit snooty and formal for my tastes.

I had heard good things about the quality and they are, as far as I know, the only place in town to serve hand-pulled noodles. \n\nFor the uninitiated, hand-pulled noodles ROCK!! Not just fresh, not just hand-cut but hand-pulled. Some places let you watch the chef twist and throw, fold, twist and throw, fold twist and throw until the gluten firms up and you have long thin strands of chewy noodle. You can't watch at VIP (it ain't no noodle joint, ya know!), but it ain't no thing ...the texture is the thing.\n\nThey have several bowls with broth to choose from. I went simple. Beef. Plenty of noodles in a nicely flavored, rich broth with a bit of 5-star anise flavor and baby bok-choy. BOOM! Major success! No skimping on the noodles or vegetables. A perfect lunch on a cold day. Next time I'll do the duck.\n\nOthers have mentioned the decor. I was skeptical when I first walked in. It felt more at home on the 30th floor of a Tokyo tower than in a west-side Madison mall. Now that I've been there I'm glad it is. The Spousal Unit will love it.","useful":4,"funny":2,"cool":1}
